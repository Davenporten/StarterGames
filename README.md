The beginnings of DT

This is mostly just for readers of my blog, not a lot to do with it. It was built on the Unity Engine (5.2) and I used this http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial tutorial to learn how to do it. Not much to it.

Also, sometimes when you open this game it goes into full screen mode and can't be exited with esc or anything, you'll need to use command + tab on the mac and then something else for the PC. Just a heads up.
